# JSTA_LUNG_ATLAS
## Motivation 
The project aims to generate cell type maps.
## INTRO
We plan to implement JSTA (Joint cell segmentation and cell type annotation) [algoritm](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202010108) to generate reference data from the human lung atlas. Then the called genes and cell segmentation from ASU combined with our data can be used to generate cell type maps. ```WIP```
